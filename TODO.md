# TODO: Implement Real-Time Latency Monitoring with latencyapi.com

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update `data/exchanges.ts` to add `probes` array with public URLs for each exchange server.
- [x] Modify `lib/latencyProvider.ts` to update `probeUrl` function to fetch latency from `https://latencyapi.com/ping?host={host}` instead of client-side fetch.
- [ ] Test the app to verify API integration and real-time updates in charts/maps.
- [ ] Check console for any API errors or rate limit issues; adjust if needed.
